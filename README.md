# HierarchicalClustering
# Project Title:
Analysis and Prediction of "mall_customers".csv of American Mall Market called as Pheonix Mall to findout on the basis of Client requirement of Dendograms using Scipy Graphics Library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy", to ace the no. of linkage of clustering to predict.
# Probem Statement:
The American Finance market Clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market. As a Datascience Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future
# Task:
1) With help of Scipy Library import libraries and datasets
2) Using the Dendogram to find th optimal number of clusters
3) Create a Hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with help of matplot library

# Conclusion:
According to the Model building as a Engineer my Prediction is Cluster3 has highest number of linkage
# Insights:
(1) Cluster1 contains (Red)color  which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 139k$

(2)Cluster2 contains (blue)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 79-80k$

(3) Cluster3 contains (green)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 139k$

(4)Cluster4 contains (cyan)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 40k$

(5)Cluster5 contains (pink)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 40k$
